          Hello World! I am a fullstack developer living in New York City and a recent graduate of the Grace Hopper Program at Fullstack Academy. Before coding, my background was in solving people problems- I studied psychology and worked in employee engagement at a tech company. I'm really excited to be transitioning into the world of software development.
